# Day 4 Report – Advanced Device Profiling & Security Testing

**Device:** Google Home (10.0.x.x)  
**Network:** 10.0.0.0/x (Private LAN)  
**Tools Used:** Nmap (7.94), MAC Vendor Lookup

---

## 1️⃣ Objective
The goal of Day 4 was to:
- Perform advanced Nmap scans for OS fingerprinting and firewall detection.
- Run safe vulnerability checks on the device.
- Collect detailed profiling data for dashboard integration.
- Validate the security posture of the Google Home device.

3️⃣ Analysis of Results
OS Fingerprint
Detected OS: [Insert result or "Google Embedded OS (probable)"]

Note: Many IoT devices restrict OS fingerprinting; results may be generalized.

Firewall Detection
Filtered ports remain filtered (confirmed for port 9000 and others).

Firewall behavior: Active and restricting external scans.

Vulnerability Scan
No known vulnerabilities detected (expected for a closed IoT device).

Device demonstrates a secure baseline configuration.

Services
Port	State	Service	Version
80	open	http	Google HTTP Server
443	open	ssl/https	TLSv1.3
8009	open	ajp13?	Unknown
9000	filtered	unknown	-

4️⃣ Key Findings
Device is running a locked-down embedded OS (likely Google-proprietary).

Minimal open ports consistent with Day 3 results.

Firewall filtering confirmed; non-essential ports remain protected.

No exploitable vulnerabilities detected with standard scripts.

TLS 1.3 usage ensures secure encrypted communications.
