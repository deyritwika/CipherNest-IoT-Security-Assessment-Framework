# ðŸ”’ CipherNest â€“ IoT Security Assessment Framework

CipherNest is a hands-on IoT security assessment project that focuses on **analyzing, visualizing, and reporting the security posture of smart home devices**.  
This project replicates a real-world security workflowâ€”network reconnaissance, traffic analysis, vulnerability scanning, and dashboard visualization.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Goal:** Evaluate IoT devices (e.g., smart speakers, bulbs) for secure configurations and potential attack surfaces.
- **Scope:** Local network analysis, port/service enumeration, TLS traffic inspection, and risk visualization.
- **Approach:** Practical, data-driven, and extensible for multi-device assessments.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Device discovery using `ARP` and `mDNS`.
- TLS handshake and SNI inspection for encryption validation.
- Port and service enumeration with Nmap.
- Risk scoring for each device.
- Interactive **Dash + Plotly dashboard**.
- Scalable JSON-based data model for adding more devices.
- Professional report-ready visual captures.
